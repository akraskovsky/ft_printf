# ft_printf
This project suggests to recode the standard <strong>printf function</strong>.<br>
Only the very limited number of standard C functions were allowed to use here:
<ul>
  <li>write</li>
  <li>malloc</li>
  <li>free</li>
  <li>exit</li>
  <li>The functions of man 3 stdarg</li>
</ul>
As well as those functions we heve already recoded and placed into FT_LIB.<br>
At least the following conversions must be realised: c, s, p, d, i, o, u, x, X, f with flags hh, h, l, ll L.<br>
The minimum field width and precision should be processed as it is made in original function.

This is very brief introduction. The full task definition is subject of School privacy.
