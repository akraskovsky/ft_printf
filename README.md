# ft_printf
This project suggests to recode the standard <strong>printf function</strong>.<br>
Only the very limited number of standard C functions was allowed to use here:
<ul>
  <li>write</li>
  <li>malloc</li>
  <li>free</li>
  <li>exit</li>
  <li>The functions of man 3 stdarg</li>
</ul>
As well as those functions we heve already recoded and placed into FT_LIB.
